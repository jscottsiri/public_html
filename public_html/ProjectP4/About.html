		<h2>The Story of Myself</h2>
		
		<aside>
			<p>Hello, here is some basic information about me for the time being:
			I grew up in a town in Northern New Jersey called Pequannock and attended
			Pequannock Township High School.</p>
			<br>
			<p>During my time at PTHS, I earned several accomplishments. These included
			earning my Eagle Scout with Troop 79 and attending Boys State and earning the rank
			of Assemblyman. I was accepted to the New Jersey Institute of Technology as a conditional
			honors student. After doing well my first semester, I became a full honors student. I
			am currently a sophomore and intend to complete my degree at NJIT.</p>
