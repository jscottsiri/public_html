			<h2>My Story So Far</h2>
				<section>
					<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I was born and raised in Pequannock, New Jersey. I grew with up an interest in computing and spent a lot of my early years using the computer to play games and meet
					people. Throughout High School, I took courses that were centered around programming and discovered I enjoyed it. I had earned my Eagle Scout award and attended the American Legion's Jersey Boys State and got the rank
					of Assemblyman. I graduated from Pequannock Township High School in 2016 and decided to go to New Jersey Institute of Technology to study Computer Science. During the summer following my Senior Year, I worked for
					my public school system's information technology department.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp After completing my first semester and getting into the Albert Dorman Honors College, I decided that NJIT's Human-Computer Interaction major was interesting and had a lot of potential. I liked
					learning about Psychology and the opportunity to have a major that incorporated both Computing and Psychology was too good to pass up. After taking a course in UX Design to test the waters, I decided switched into it. During the summer of 2017, I interned at Crestron Electronics with part of their Customer Experience\Tradeshow department. While there, I learned
					about how technology centered businesses work and improved my ability to design things with the customer in mind (in addition to programming some machines and preparing for tradeshows). I am currently still taking courses at NJIT (my GPA is 3.87 at the moment) and plan on
					completing my degree in the spring of 2020.</p>
