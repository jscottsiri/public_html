					<p>This website itself is a pretty good example of what I can do with a few hours of work. I intend to add more
					to it as I enhance my skills (especially with javascript) and make it more responsive.
					However, I have done more than this and will continue to progress afterwards. I will add more projects
					as they develop.</p>
					<br>
					<p><a href='IS247FinalReport.pdf'>Fitness App Project</a>:
					<br>
					This was a project that my team did for my 'Designing the User Experience' course.
					At the moment, none of us had any real HTML/CSS experience, so it was a big learning experience.
					The project includes Personas, Scenarios, Analysis, Planning, and a Mock up of the project. I was a
					major part of the production of the project and was involved throughout the project.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p><a href='https://web.njit.edu/~jss82/ProjectP4/index.html'>Original Website</a>:
					<br>
					This was the website I had initially made for my 'Introduction to Website Development' course.
					Functionally it is fine, but I had played too safe with the design on it. I effectively just
					wanted to ensure that I hit all the requirements of the website.
					<p>
					<br>
					<p><a href='TicTacToeReloadedV3.py'>Tic-Tac-Toe Python</a>:
					<br>
					This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game built for my 'Roadmap to Computing' course. It requires two players
					and involves a simple interface.
